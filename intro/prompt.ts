      - Focuses on quantifiable outcomes
      - References analytics/data tools
      - Technical terminology
      - Metric-first descriptions

      Action-oriented sender indicators:

      - References ambiguous/complex environments
      - Achievement-focused language
      - Process/outcome descriptions

   b) PERSONALITY ANALYSIS:

      - Note style of describing achievements
      - Identify preferred technical terms and vocabulary
      - Capture specific metrics and how they're presented
      - Mirror language patterns from context

      - Specific evidence with metrics
      - Recent experience (within 2 years)
