**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Author:** Frank Harris & Gemini

## 1. Overview & Background

This document outlines the requirements for the complete redesign of the hirefrank.com website. The project's primary goal is to transition from a simple, personal portfolio site to a strategic, high-converting landing page modeled after successful SaaS products.

The core of this strategic shift involves moving away from a simple per-session pricing model to a productized, tiered subscription service. This will better segment the audience, clarify the value proposition, and create a more scalable business model with predictable revenue. The new design will focus on clearly communicating Frank's unique value as an operator-turned-coach to three distinct audience segments.

## 2. Goals & Objectives

### Business Goals
- Increase client acquisition, particularly for longer-term, higher-value engagements (Premium and Custom tiers)
- Establish a scalable, predictable revenue stream through a subscription model
- Reduce time spent on one-off, low-commitment sessions

### User Goals
- Allow potential clients to quickly self-identify and understand the specific value Frank provides for their unique challenges (Founder, VP, IC)
- Provide clear, transparent pricing and a simple, low-friction path to engagement

### Project Goals
- Launch a new, fully responsive, single-page website for the "Coaching" section
- Implement a clean, modern, light-themed aesthetic that builds trust and professionalism

## 3. Target Audience

The website will be designed to speak to three primary personas:

### 1. The Head of Function (Primary Target)
A VP or Director at a scale-up company (Series B to Public).

**Core Need:** To scale their team by developing their next layer of leaders ("lieutenants") because they lack the time for intensive 1:1 mentoring.

### 2. The Founder
An early-stage founder (Seed to Series B) who is acting as the de facto product leader.

**Core Need:** A confidential, experienced sounding board to help navigate the immense pressure and high-stakes decisions of building a company.

### 3. The IC / New Leader
A high-performing individual contributor or new manager at a tech company.

**Core Need:** Actionable guidance to break through career plateaus, grow their impact, and navigate the path to senior leadership, with or without a formal title.
